          <h2>Health Risks Correlations with Poverty, Age, and Income</h2>
          <hr>
          <h3>Poverty</h3>
          <p>This variable shows an inverse relation with healthcare availability, but no correlation with smoking. As poverty increases, 
            there is a decrease in healthcare, which translates in poorer people getting less medical attention. On the other hand, there is no significant
            relation of smokers with their income level, meaning poor people still spend money on cigarrettes, although there's no evidence on quantity, which could differ among socioeconomic strata.
          </p>
          <h3>Age</h3>
          <p>
            Healthcare and obesity tend to decrease with age, but smoking increases as people get older. Nevertheless, there's no clear evidence
            that these data is sufficient to prove a conclusion for this variables' relation, so further data should be analyzed for a more reliable interpretation.
          </p>
          <h3>Income</h3>
          <p>As income increases, a greater section of the population is provided with healthcare, and obesity levels decrease. As said before,
            smoking links with socioeconomic levels are not clear and don't show direct correlation.
